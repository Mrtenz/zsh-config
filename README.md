# ZSH Configurations

This repository contains my configurations for (oh-my-)ZSH. These files should be placed in `$ZSH_CUSTOM`.

## Plugins

I'm using the following plugins, most of which need to be installed manually:

```
plugins=(
  git
  zsh-nvm
  zsh-autosuggestions
  zsh-completions
  zsh-syntax-highlighting
)
```
